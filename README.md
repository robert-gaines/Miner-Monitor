# Miner-Monitor
Python Script developed to monitor performance characteristics on a large number of L3,D3, &amp; S9 (ASIC) Miners

This script was authored at the request of the Network Operations Team from the GigaWatt Corporation. 

The intent was to deploy the script on Network Monitoring stations. Performance data would be gathered over HTTP and relayed
to a database and/or the Zabbix application.
